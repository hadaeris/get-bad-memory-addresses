# get-bad-memory-addresses
Takes a MemTest86 file and parses for all memory pages, generating a bcdedit command to blacklist them from the OS.

This super quick script is meant for Windows, and is by no means a permanent fix. I used this to extend the lifespan of one of my laptop's memory for about 6 months before it entirely gave up.

TO USE:
1. Run MemTest86 from an external drive. Instructions can be found at https://www.memtest86.com/
2. Find the MemTest86.log file generated by the program onto the external drive
3. Put the file in the same folder as parseLog.py, and run python parseLog.py MemTest86.log
4. parseLog.py will generate an output.txt file, which contains the command to run
5. Run CMD in administrator mode and run the command.

CHECK IF IT IS WORKING:
1. Download RAMMap from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap
2. Run the application and navigate to the Physical Ranges tab.
3. Check if the appropriate addresses are being skipped over, the ones generated by parseLog.py
