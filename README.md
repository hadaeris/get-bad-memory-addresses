# get-bad-memory-addresses
Takes a MemTest86 file and parses for all bad memory pages, generating a bcdedit command to blacklist them from the OS.

Included is a sample input and output that I ran on my old laptop.

This super quick script is meant for Windows, and is by no means a permanent fix. I used this to extend the lifespan of my laptop's memory for about 6 months before it entirely gave up.

TO USE:
1. Run MemTest86 from an external drive. Instructions can be found at https://www.memtest86.com/
2. Find the MemTest86.log file generated by the program onto the external drive
3. Put the file in the same folder as parseLog.py, and run python parseLog.py MemTest86.log
4. parseLog.py will generate an output.txt file, which contains the command to run
5. Run CMD in administrator mode and run the command.
6. Restart

CHECK IF IT IS WORKING:
1. Download RAMMap from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap
2. Run the application and navigate to the Physical Ranges tab.
3. Check if the appropriate addresses are being skipped over, the ones generated by parseLog.py

NOTE: it may take a couple restarts for the changes to take effect. Not sure why but that's what happened in my experience. Also not guaranteed to resolve your issue.
